<h1>PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>Volume 104, April 8th 1893</h2>
<h3>edited by Sir Francis Burnand </h3>

 <hr class="full" />

 <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
<h2>SPORTING ANSWERS.</h2>

<h3>ANGLING.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Fleacatcher.</span>&mdash;Yes, the trout in the river
Itching (this is the only correct spelling)
are red, and, before they are boiled, raw.
The best method of catching them is to tickle
them. When you have hooked an Itching
trout, you first scratch him, and then cook
him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Novice.</span>&mdash;We only knew one man who could
make a decent rod, and he
died twenty years ago.
Remember the old adage
so dear to <span class="sc">Izaak</span>, <i>Qui parcit
virg&aelig; spoliat puerum</i>. For
instructions as to use of
implement, and translation
of Latin, apply to any
head-master. Failure in
the latter will inevitably
lead to application of the
former. Then pause for
reflection, but <i>don't sit
down</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Spook.</span>&mdash;What on earth
is the use of applying to
us about a phantom? We
never keep one on the
premises. Try personal
interview with <span class="sc">W. T.
Stead</span>, who has a fine
selection, <span class="sc">Julia</span> being
specially effective. Why
do you ask if we generally
spin? Not having been
born a top, we prefer walking.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Contemplative.</span>&mdash;(1) It's
absolutely useless offering
us these paltry inducements
to betray the secrets
of our skill. We are&mdash;we
hope we may say it without
undue pride&mdash;an All-Round
Angler, and we are
not going to be squared by
a bait of that kind. (2)
We have never pretended
we were a salmon. If
<span class="sc">Andrew Lang</span> says we
have, we challenge him to
repeat it to our face before
witnesses. (3) Whitebait
are no longer kept in the
Round Pond at Kensington.
We knew as many as four
there ten years ago.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Calipee.</span>&mdash;You are quite
right. When a ship turns
turtle the fact is instantly
communicated to the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen of
the City of London. They
proceed to the spot in the
<i>Maria Wood</i>, and the one
who secures the interesting saurian is allowed
to eat all the green fat. With you we hope
devoutly that the time is far distant when
the desecrating hand of a Socialistic Government
will be allowed to lay a finger on these
ancient civic customs. No. The Fishmongers'
Company do not sell fish. Their motto is,
<i>Edo, non vendo</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Acton Est.</span>&mdash;<i>The Cornhill Magazine</i> for
this month has an interesting article on
"Actors and Actresses in Westminster
Abbey," not seen there much when alive,
but there for good after their decease. It
is stated of Mrs. <span class="sc">Barry</span> that she was not
interred in the Abbey, as has been, it appears,
generally supposed, but found her resting-place
at Acton. Odd, that when she had
ceased to act, she should be sent to Act-on!</p>

<h4>"TAKE CARE OF THE PENCE, AND THE POUNDS," &amp;c.</h4>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> "<span class="sc">Mamma, what have you got the Carriage out for so late?
Where <i>are</i> you going?</span>"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Goldie.</i> "<span class="sc">Now, Muriel, you know how your Father keeps worrying
about Extravagance, and of course I must set an Example. So I'm going
to the Public Library to see the Evening Paper!</span>"</p>

<h3>THE CRY OF THE CUE-IST.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Champion, by a Discouraged Competitor.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Break, break, break,</p>
<p class="i2">On the smooth green board, O <span class="sc">John</span>!</p>
<p>And I would civil words could utter</p>
<p class="i2">My thoughts, as the game goes on!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>O well for the three-figure runs</p>
<p class="i2">You have made since we opened play!</p>
<p>O ill for my nine thousand start,</p>
<p class="i2">Which you're lessening day by day!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And the marvellous shots go on</p>
<p class="i2">To your score, which is mounting still!</p>
<p>But O for a touch of that wondrous hand,</p>
<p class="i2">And a slice of that startling skill!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Break, break, break!</p>
<p class="i2"><i>There's</i> a shot! Great Scott! O, see!</p>
<p>What tender grace! And if once ahead</p>
<p class="i2">You will never "come back" to me!</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">Epsom Spring Meeting.</span>"&mdash;In former
times this used to be a fashionable rendezvous
for invalids who went there to drink
the beneficial waters of the Epsom Spring.
Now there is not much water taken at these
Spring Meetings; and what water is taken
is not "an unmixed good."

<span class="sc">A Lesson in "Book-keeping.</span>"&mdash;Never

<h3>AFTER THE VOLUNTEER REVIEW.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>An Office.</i> <span class="sc">Brown</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Jones</span>
<i>discovered
talking over the incidents of the
recent holiday.</i></p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Yes; I was up at six on the
Monday.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Well, you were in luck; for I had
to be ready by four. The battalion had to
be drawn up at the station by 4&middot;45.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> To be sure. You went down before
we did.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Yes. I wish we
had got some coffee before
starting.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> But you had
your breakfast on your
arrival, didn't you?</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Yes, to be sure;
but as we were a bit late,
it was rather a scramble.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Well, of course
one has to get on to parade as
soon as possible. We cut it
rather fine too. But that's
the case with all of us.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> To be sure; and
if you lose time at one
end, you must make up for
it at the other&mdash;that stands
to reason. And how did
you get on?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> First rate. We
were on the march from
nine to five.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> So were we; and
didn't have time scarcely
to get to our havresacks.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Just our fortune.
Always on the move. I
wore out my leathers in
fine style.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> So did I. And
then we had to go back to
the train before we could
get any dinner.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> My fate too.
And, when I got home, the
slavey had forgotten to lay
supper!</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> So had mine.
But still it was a glorious
holiday&mdash;now, wasn't it?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> I should say it
was! A glorious holiday!</p>

<p>[<i>They return to their ledgers</i>.</p>

<h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Abscondrelism.</span>&mdash;I
belong to a Building
Society. At present the
concern is exceptionally
prosperous, and I have no
reason to suppose that the
Directors and Manager are
not scrupulously honest. Still, it is as well
to be prepared for all eventualities, and, as a
couple of years seems to be about the time
required by the authorities before they can
make up their minds to prosecute anybody,
I should like to know if I could apply for a
warrant against the officials of my Society
<i>at once</i>, so as to have everything ready in
case any of them should develop fraudulent
tendencies a few years hence? Would there
be any objection to this? Perhaps some legal
reader would reply. Also, is it a fact that
Messrs. <span class="sc">Balbert and Hurlfour</span> have started
a model Colony, on entirely new and philanthropic
lines, in Mexico, and are inviting
English settlers (unconnected with the
"Liberator" Society) to join them there,
the prospectus of the scheme being headed:&mdash;"By
kind permission of the Public Prosecutor"?&mdash;<span class="sc">Prophylactic</span>.</p>

<h3>HER "DAY OF REST."</h3>

<h4>(<i>The Song of the Shop-Girl.</i>)</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<a href="images/158.png"><img width="100%" src="images/158.png" alt="As one poor shop-girl said:&mdash;'After the fatigue and worry of the week...." /></a>
<p>"As one poor shop-girl said:&mdash;'After the fatigue and worry of
the week, I am so thoroughly worn out, that my only thought is to rest on a
Sunday; but it goes too quickly, and the other days drag on so slowly!'"&mdash;<i>Quoted by
Sir John Lubbock in the recent Debate on Early Closing for Shops.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Eight o'clock strikes!</p>
<p class="i6">The short day's sped,&mdash;</p>
<p>My Day of Rest! That beating in my head</p>
<p>Hammers on still, like coffin-taps. He likes,</p>
<p>Our lynx-eyed chief, to see us brisk and trim</p>
<p>On Monday mornings; and though brains may swim,</p>
<p>And breasts sink sickeningly with nameless pain,</p>
<p><i>He</i> cannot feel the faintness and the strain,</p>
<p>And what are they to him?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">This morning's sun peeped in</p>
<p class="i6">Invitingly, as though to win</p>
<p>My footsteps fieldwards, just one day in seven!</p>
<p>The thought of hedgerows was like opening heaven,</p>
<p class="i6">And the stray sunray's gleam,</p>
<p class="i4">Threading the dingy blind,</p>
<p class="i6">Seemed part of a sweet dream,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
<p>For in our sleep the Fates <i>are</i> sometimes kind.</p>
<p>"Come out!" it said, "but not with weary tread,</p>
<p class="i6">And feet of lead,</p>
<p>The long, mud-cumbered, cold, accustomed way,</p>
<p>For the great Shop is shuttered close to-day,</p>
<p class="i4">And you awhile are free!"</p>
<p><i>Free?</i> With a chain of iron upon my heart,</p>
<p>That drags me down, and makes the salt tears start!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, that inexorable weariness</p>
<p>That through the enfeebled flesh lays crushing stress</p>
<p class="i2">On the young spirit! Young? There is no youth</p>
<p class="i2">For such as I. It dies, in very truth,</p>
<p>At the first touch of the taskmaster's hand.</p>
<p>A doctrine hard for you to understand,</p>
<p class="i2">Gay sisters of the primrose path,</p>
<p>Whose only chain is as a flowery band.</p>
<p class="i2">The toil that outstays nature hath</p>
<p>A palsying power, a chilling force</p>
<p>Which freezes youth at its fresh source.</p>
<p class="i4">Only the Comus wand</p>
<p>Of an unhallowed Pleasure offers such</p>
<p>Freedom, and with pollution in its touch.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">The languid lift</p>
<p>Of head from pillow tells us the good gift</p>
<p>Of Sabbath rest is more than half in vain.</p>
<p class="i2">Tired! Tired! In flesh, bone, brain,</p>
<p class="i2">Heart, fancy, pulse, and nerve!</p>
<p>Such is our doom who stand and serve</p>
<p>The unrewarding public, thoughtless they</p>
<p class="i2">Of slaves whose souls they slay!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, that long standing&mdash;standing&mdash;standing yet!</p>
<p>With the flesh sick, the inmost soul a-fret,</p>
<p class="i2">Pale, pulseless patiences, our very sex,</p>
<p>That should be a protection, one more load</p>
<p class="i2">To lade, and chafe, and vex.</p>
<p>No tired ox urged to tramping by the goad</p>
<p class="i2">Feels a more mutely-maddening weariness</p>
<p>Than we white, black-garbed spectral girls who stand</p>
<p>Stonily smiling on while ladies grand,</p>
<p class="i2">Easily seated, idly turn and toss</p>
<p class="i2">The samples; and our Watcher, 'neath the gloss</p>
<p>Of courtly smugness glaring menace, stalks</p>
<p>About us, creaking cruelty as he walks.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Stand! Stand! Still stand!</p>
<p class="i4">Clenched teeth and clutching hand,</p>
<p>Swift blanching cheek, and twitching muscle, tell</p>
<p>To those who know, what <i>we</i> know all too well,</p>
<p class="i4">Ignored by Fashion, coldly mocked by Trade.</p>
<p class="i4">Are we not for the sacrifice arrayed</p>
<p>In dainty vesture? Pretty, too, they say</p>
<p>Male babblers, whom our sufferings and poor pay</p>
<p class="i4">Might shock, could they but guess</p>
<p class="i4">Trim figure and smart dress</p>
<p>Cover and hide, from all but doctor-ken,</p>
<p>Disease and threatening death. Oh! men, men, men!</p>
<p class="i2">You bow, smile, flatter&mdash;aught but <i>understand</i>!</p>
<p class="i6">Long hours lay lethal hand</p>
<p>Upon our very vitals. Seats might save</p>
<p class="i6">From an untimely grave,</p>
<p>Hundreds of harried, inly anguished girls;</p>
<p><i>You</i> see&mdash;their snow-girt throats and neatly-ordered curls!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Out to the green fields? Nay,</p>
<p class="i4">This all too fleeting day</p>
<p>To rest is dedicate. But not the rest</p>
<p>Of brightened spirit, and of lightened breast.</p>
<p>The dull, dead, half-inanimate leaden crouch</p>
<p>Of sheer exhaustion on this shabby couch</p>
<p class="i4">Is all my week's repose.</p>
<p class="i4">Read? But the tired eyes close,</p>
<p class="i2">The book from nerveless fingers drops;</p>
<p class="i4">Almost the slow heart stops.</p>
<p>But the clock halts not on its restless round.</p>
<p>Weariness shudders at the whirring sound,</p>
<p class="i4">As the sharp strike declares</p>
<p class="i4">Swift to its closing wears</p>
<p>One more of those brief interludes from toil</p>
<p>Which leave us still the labour-despot's spoil,</p>
<p class="i2">Slaves of long hours and unrelaxing strain,</p>
<p class="i2">Unstrengthened and unsolaced, soon again</p>
<p class="i2">To tread the round, and lift the lengthening chain;</p>
<p><i>Stand</i>&mdash;till hysteria lays its hideous clutch</p>
<p>On our girl-hearts, or epilepsy's touch</p>
<p class="i2">Thrills through tired nerves and palsied brain.</p>
<p class="i6">Again&mdash;again&mdash;again!</p>
<p><i>How long?</i> Till Death, upon its kindly quest,</p>
<p class="i4">Gives a true Day of Rest!

<p><span class="sc">Royal Rewards to Good Players</span>.&mdash;"As
a sequel to the performance of <i>Becket</i> at
Windsor, Mr. <span class="sc">Irving</span>"&mdash;as we were informed
by the <i>Daily News</i>&mdash;"was presented by the
<span class="sc">Queen</span> with a stud." What will he do with
the stud? Will he take to the turf, go racing,
and keep the stud at some Newmarket
training-stables? Perhaps "the stud" consisted
of fifty "ponies"&mdash;but this is a purse-an'-all
matter, into which we are not at
liberty to inquire. Miss <span class="sc">Ellen Terry</span> received
a brooch from <span class="sc">Her Majesty</span>, on
which are the letters "V.R.I." Our <span class="sc">'Arry</span>
says these initials signify "<i>Ve Are 'I</i>ghly

as speaking, V.R.I, might mean, says

<h3>AT AN AFTERNOON ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Prince's Hall, Piccadilly. Among the Audience are</i>&mdash;A
London Aunt, <i>and her</i> Eldest Daughter, <i>with a</i> Cousin from
the Country, <i>who is just a little difficult to amuse; a</i> Serious-minded
Lady <i>from Brixton, with a more frivolous</i> Friend;
<i>a pair of</i> Fianc&eacute;s; <i>and an</i> Unsophisticated Father, <i>with an</i>
Up-to-date little Daughter. <i>An exhibition of "Pure Sleight-of-Hand"
has just been given on the Stage.</i></p>

<p><i>The Serious Lady.</i> Clever? Yes, my dear, it is <i>clever</i> enough, if
that's all; but I never can
quite reconcile <i>my</i> conscience
to encouraging a fellow-creature
to make a living by
deliberate deception!</p>

<p><i>Her Friend.</i> Oh, I don't
see any harm in conjuring,
myself.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> I can't forget
that Pharaoh had his Sorcerers
and Magicians, and
how <i>they</i> acted!</p>

<p><i>Her Friend.</i> Ah, I never
saw <i>them</i>.</p>

<p><i>The London Aunt</i> (<i>to her</i>
Niece). Enjoying it, <span class="sc">Sophy</span>?
Such a <i>treat</i> for you, to see
really good conjuring!</p>

<p><i>Sophy.</i> Yes, Aunt, thank
you. But our new Curate
did that trick with <i>two</i>
rabbits at the last Penny
Readings we had!</p>

<p>[<i>A calico screen is brought
forward on which the
Entertainer throws various
shadows with his
hands.</i></p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> Is that a little
house at the corner? Oh,
he doesn't do <i>that</i> with his
hands&mdash;then I see no merit
in it. Who's that? (<i>A
small male shadow, cast by
the performer's right hand,
crosses the screen, and knocks
timidly at the door, which
is opened by the left hand,
in the character of a little
Lady. The couple embrace
effusively, and retire inside.</i>)
Ah, that's the husband
coming home!</p>

<p>[<i>Another male shadow enters
and knocks furiously,
while the little Lady
reconnoitres cautiously
from the window above.</i></p>

<p><i>Her Friend.</i> I expect <i>that</i>
must be the husband.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> What?&mdash;and
the wife behaving like that
in his absence! If I thought
<i>that</i> was the&mdash;&mdash; (<i>The first
male shadow comes out, and
fights the second, who retreats,
worsted.</i>) I never saw anything
so scandalous. How
you can call yourself consistent,
and sit there and
<i>laugh</i> at such things&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Her Friend</i> (<i>apologetically</i>).
I can't help laughing&mdash;and,
after all, perhaps they're only rival lovers, or he's her
<i>father</i>, or something.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> And she inviting one to come into the house in that
bold way&mdash;a nice example for young persons! Look there, he's
come back with a flageolet, and she's actually poured a jug of
water on his head out of the window! "Only a pair of hands," did
you say? So it <i>may</i> be&mdash;but we all know <i>who</i> it is that "Finds
some mischief still For idle hands to do"&mdash;and there we have an
illustration of it, my dear.</p>

<p>[<i>She shakes herself down in her sealskins with virtuous
disapproval.</i></p>

<p><i>The Unsophisticated Father</i> (<i>who has been roaring with laughter</i>).
Capital! It is amazingly clever, 'pon my word! Can't imagine
how they do these things&mdash;can <i>you</i>, <span class="sc">Vivvie</span>? [<i>To Up-to-Date
Child.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Vivien.</i> Oh, well I've seen so much conjuring at parties,
you know, Father, that I don't notice it particularly,&mdash;but it's nice
to see <i>you</i> so amused!</p>

<p><i>The U. F.</i> I'm <i>young</i>, you see, <span class="sc">Vivvie</span>; but I hope you're
not
bored?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss V.</span> No, I'm not <i>bored</i>&mdash;only I thought there'd be some
Serpentine dancing, and more of the <i>Music Hall</i> about it.</p>

<p><i>The U. F.</i> Music Hall! Why, what do <i>you</i> know about Music
Halls, eh?</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> (<i>with calm superiority</i>). Several of their songs&mdash;if
you call <i>that</i> anything.</p>

<p><i>The U. F.</i> I should be inclined to call it a good deal too
much!</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> (<i>compassionately</i>). Would you? Poor dear Father!
But you never <i>were</i> very modern, were you?</p>

<p>[<i>A Blind-folded Lady on the Stage has been reading and
adding up figures on a black board, and now offers to tell
the day of the week of any person's birth in the audience.</i></p>

<p><i>Her Colleague.</i> Will some
gentleman kindly oblige me
with the date of his birth?</p>

<p><i>The Fianc&eacute;e.</i> Now, <span class="sc">Jack</span>,
tell yours. I <i>want</i> you to.</p>

<p><i>Jack</i> (<i>in an unnaturally
gruff voice</i>). Fourteenth of
February, eighteen-sixty-nine!</p>

<p><i>The Blindfolded Lady</i>
(<i>with the air of the Delphic
Pythia</i>). Yes&mdash;<i>that</i> fell upon
a Monday. [<i>Applause.</i></p>

<p><i>Her Coll.</i> Is that correct,
Sir?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Don't know.</p>

<p>[<i>He reddens, and tries to
look unconscious.</i></p>

<p><i>Her Coll.</i> Now I will ask
the Lady if she can mention
some event of importance
that took place on the same
date.</p>

<p><i>The Bl. L.</i> Let me think.
Yes. (<i>Solemnly.</i>) On the
same date, in the year seventeen-hundred-and-thirty-seven,
goloshes were first
invented! [<i>Loud applause.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> (<i>as the pair retire</i>).
Well, thank goodness, we've
seen the last of that beastly
black-board. I didn't come
here to add up sums. What
is it next? Oh, a "Farmyard
Imitator." I expect
that will be rather rot,
Father, don't you?</p>

<p>[<i>Enter a Gentleman in evening
dress who gives realistic
imitations of various
live-stock.</i></p>

<p><i>The Country Cousin.</i>
That's <i>exactly</i> the way our
little Berkshire pig grunts,
and "Sweetlips" calls her
calf just like that&mdash;and, oh,
<span class="sc">Katie</span>, I <i>wonder</i> if he could
have heard our Dorkings
clucking at home&mdash;I think
he <i>must</i> have&mdash;he does it so
exactly the same!</p>

<p><i>Katie.</i> Then you do think
<i>that's</i> clever, <span class="sc">Sophy</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sophy.</i> Oh, well&mdash;for an <i>imitation</i>, you know!</p>

<p>[<i>A "Sensational Cage Mystery" is introduced; a pretty child
is shut up in a cage, which is opened a moment after, and
found to contain a Negro who capers out, grinning.</i></p>

<p><i>The London Aunt.</i> <span class="sc">Sophy</span>, do you see that?&mdash;there's a black
man there now, instead!</p>

<p><i>Sophy</i> (<i>without enthusiasm</i>). Yes, Aunt, I see, thank you.</p>

<p><i>Katie.</i> Don't you <i>like</i> it, <span class="sc">Sophy</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sophy.</i> I don't see why it need have been a <i>Nigger</i>!</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> (<i>after a "Humorous Musical Sketch" by a clever and,
charming young Lady</i>). Like <i>that</i>, my dear?&mdash;a Young Woman
giving a description of how she actually went on the Stage, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
imitating men in that way! It was as much as <i>I</i> could do to sit
still in my seat!</p>

<p><i>Her Friend.</i> I must say I thought it was very amusing.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> Amusing? I daresay. But, to my mind, young girls
have no <i>business</i> to be amusing, and take off other people. I've no
opinion of such ways myself. I don't know what my dear Mother
would have done if <i>I'd</i> ever been amusing&mdash;she would have broken
her heart, I do believe!</p>

<p><i>The Friend</i> (<i>to herself</i>). She wouldn't have split her sides, that's
very certain!</p>

<p>[<i>A</i> Lady Physiognomist <i>appears in cap and gown, and invites
a subject to step upon the stage, and have his or her character
revealed.</i></p>

<h4>"He blinks and smiles in feeble confusion."</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Jack</i> (<i>to his Fianc&eacute;e</i>). No, I say&mdash;but look here, <span class="sc">Flossie</span>,
<i>really</i>
I'd rather not&mdash;with all these people looking!</p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> Then I shall think you've something to <i>conceal</i>,
<span class="sc">Jack</span>&mdash;you
wouldn't like me to feel that <i>already</i>, would you?</p>

<p>[<span class="sc">Jack</span>, <i>resignedly, mounts the platform, and occupies a chair, in
which he blinks and smiles in feeble confusion, while the</i>
Professor <i>studies his features dispassionately.</i></p>

<p><i>The Lady Phys.</i> The first thing to notice is the disposition of the
ears. Now here we have a Gentleman whose ears stick out in a
very remarkable manner. [<i>Delight of Audience.</i></p>

<p><i>Flossie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). They <i>do</i>&mdash;awfully! I never noticed it
before.
But it really rather suits him; at least&mdash;&mdash; [<i>She meditates.</i></p>

<p><i>The L. Ph.</i> This denotes an original and inquiring mind; this
gentleman takes nothing on trust&mdash;likes to see everything for
himself; he observes a good deal more than he ever says anything
about. His nose is wide at the tip, showing a trustful and confiding
disposition; it has a bump in the centre, denoting a moderate amount
of combativeness. The nostrils indicate a keen sense of humour.
(<i>Here</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>giggles bashfully.</i>) There is a twist in the
upper lip,
which indicates&mdash;well, I won't say that he would actually tell an
<i>untruth</i>&mdash;but if he had the opportunity for doing so, he has the
capacity for taking advantage of it. I think that is all I have to
say about this Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Flossie</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>, <i>after he has returned to her
side</i>). <span class="sc">Jack</span>, if you
can't leave off having an original and inquiring mind, you must at
least promise me <i>one</i> thing&mdash;it's very little to ask!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> You know I'd do any blessed thing in the world for you
<span class="sc">Flossie</span>,&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p><i>Flossie.</i> Only to wear an elastic round your ears at night, <span class="sc">Jack</span>!</p>

<p><i>The Unsophisticated Father</i> (<i>at the conclusion of the exhibition,
as the Missing Lady disappears with a bang, in full view of the
Audience</i>). There, <span class="sc">Vivvie</span>; she's vanished clean away. What do
you say to that, eh?</p>

<p><i>Vivien</i> (<i>composedly</i>). Well, I think we may as well vanish too
Father. It's all over!</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> (<i>going out</i>). I don't wish to judge <i>others</i>&mdash;far
from it&mdash;but,
speaking for myself, <span class="sc">Eliza</span>, I <i>cannot</i> feel this has been a
profitable
method of employing precious moments which can never be
recalled.</p>

<p><i>Her Friend.</i> Oh, it's quite early. You'll have plenty of time to
get a cup of tea, and do some shopping before it's dark.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> (<i>severely</i>). That was not precisely what I <i>meant</i>,
<span class="sc">Eliza</span>!</p>

<p>[<i>But it is precisely what she does.</i></p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p>Seeing that <i>A Wild Wooing</i> (published by <span class="sc">F. V. White &amp; Co.</span>)
is by <span class="sc">Florence Warden</span>, authoress of <i>The House on the Marsh</i>,
the Baron anticipated a real treat. But he was somewhat disappointed.
The novel is in one volume, which is an attraction, and
that volume is of a portable size, which is another note in its
favour; also it is not illustrated, which is an undisguised blessing.
The story is interesting up to a certain point, which, however,
does not take you very far into the book, and, after this point, the
murmurings behind walls, the moving and dragging of heavy
bodies under the floors, the insecure rope-ladders, the trap-doors,
cellars, underground passages, smugglers, murderers, victims, and
all sorts of mixed mysteries, become tiresome.
There is yet another fault, which is, that the story is not
told in so convincing a style as to make the
reader feel quite sure that the authoress is not "getting at him"
all the time, and just trying to see what quantity of old melodramatic
stuff he will patiently stand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 25%;"><a href="images/161.png"><img width="100%" src="images/161.png" alt="At Easter Time the Baron de B.-W. visits his friend The Peer of Brighton" /></a>
<h4>At Easter Time the Baron de B.-W. visits his friend<br />
<i>The</i> Peer of Brighton.</h4>
</div>

<p>Henceforth <span class="sc">Florence Warden</span> will do well to get away from
the rusty bars, bolts, chains, trap-doors, and cellars, from ruined
castles, as grim as that of <i>Udolpho</i>, "of which," as Sir <span class="sc">Walter</span>
said
in his preface to <i>Waverley</i>, "the Eastern wing had long been uninhabited,
and the keys either lost, or consigned to the care of some
aged butler or housekeeper, whose trembling steps, &amp;c., &amp;c."
Accidentally, turning from "White" to "Black," the Baron took up
the first volume of the excellent re-issue of the <i>Waverley Novels</i>, by
Messrs. <span class="sc">Adam and Charles Black</span>, called <i>The Dryburgh Edition</i>,
and commenced reading the introductory chapter of <i>Waverley</i>, which
at that time, gave the death-thrust to the melodramatic horrors of
romantic tales, whether evolved from the inner consciousness of English
writers, or openly acknowledged as "taken from the German."</p>

<p>In view of the sensational romance of the present day, towards
which, when really good, the Baron owns to having a decided leaning&mdash;it
is interesting to note how brave Sir <span class="sc">Walter</span> defied the existing
fashion in novels of his own time, spurned the sentimental
"Mordaunts," the "Belvilles," and such like played-out names of
ancient chivalry, laughed at the heroine "with a profusion of
auburn hair and a harp," and, like the Magician of the North that
he was, boldly gave to the world his historic novels, in which, where
History doesn't suit the requirements of fiction, it is so much the
worse for History. Are there very many of the present generation
who have not read Sir <span class="sc">Walter Scott's</span> novels? If there be
any&mdash;and there must be, or where would be the demand to occasion
this new and admirably devised supply&mdash;let them at once put
aside modern sensationalism, and commence <span class="sc">Walter Scott</span> as a
study. The Baron knows personally one man of mature years,
who has read neither <i>Waverley</i> nor several others of the series,
and him he envies, for, as the student in question has already set
himself to the task, he has the greatest literary pleasure of his life
yet to come. Type, size of book, excellent as a library edition;
and the illustrations, so far as they have gone, are good, and not
too distracting. And so, after this unequivocal expression of his
sentiments, he signs himself, <span class="sc">The Bold Baron de B.-W.</span></p>

<h3>BACK TO SCHOOL;</h3>
<h4><span class="sc">Or, Doctor Blimber-Gladstone and his "Lit-tle Friends."</span></h4>

<h4>(<i>Dombeyish Fragments, with a smack of "The Mikado."</i>)</h4>

<p>Whenever a young gentleman was taken in hand by Dr. <span class="sc">Blimber-Gladstone</span>,
he might consider himself sure of a pretty tight squeeze.
The Doctor only undertook the charge of a limited number of young
gentlemen at a time, but he had always ready a supply of "cram"
for a hundred, on the lowest estimate; and it was at once the
business and delight of his life to gorge "his young friends," few or
many, to their utmost capacity, and sometimes beyond it.</p>

<p>In fact, Dr. <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> establishment was a great Hothouse, in
which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work. All the
boys blew before their time&mdash;or so said the Doctor's rivals and foes.
Mental Green Peas were produced in February, and intellectual
Scarlet-Runners in March. Mathematical Great Gooseberries were
common at untimely seasons, other than the appropriate Silly one.</p>

<p>This was all very pleasant and ingenious, but the system of forcing
was attended with its usual disadvantage. There was sometimes
not the right taste about the premature productions, and they didn't
always keep well.</p>

<p>The Doctor's was a mighty fine House, fronting the river. Not
always a joyful style of House within; sometimes quite the contrary.
The seats were in rows, like figures in a sum. The sitters also were
often in rows&mdash;with a slight (phonetic) difference. The House was
well provided with Hot Water, on the "constant-supply" system.
But somehow this seemed rather to conduce to discomfort than to
real cleanliness,&mdash;like the too frequent and tumultuous "turning-outs"
of an over-zealous housewife. A "Spring Clean," at St.
Stephen's School, was a thing to remember, and shudder at. It was
not a quiet House at the best of times. It seemed ever haunted by
the Banshee of Noise, and disturbed by the cacophonous ghosts of
dead Echoes. At the peacefulest periods it was pervaded by a
baneful Spook called the "Party Spirit," and always by the dull
booings of unwilling young gentlemen at their lessons, like the
raucous murmurings of an assemblage of melancholy rooks, or of
kites and crows cawing and screaming in the intervals of their
clamorous scufflings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Holidays? Oh dear yes! If there was one thing Doctor <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span>
"young friends" <i>did</i> care for, it was Holidays! The
Doctor himself seemed as though he could&mdash;and were it possible&mdash;would
do without them. But the Doctor's "lit-tle friends," however
docile, could never be brought to see <i>that</i>. They did not
usually commence their Spring "term" until February. And they
were rips, even rampant, for a long "Recess" at Easter. When
the Doctor, using his well-beloved formula, said, "Gentlemen, we
will resume our studies upon&mdash;&mdash;" they hung upon his words, and,
if the conclusion of his formula showed any disposition to cut the
Holidays short, they howled loudly in chorus, like hungry wolves
disappointed of their quarry.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a sight to see Doctor <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> little friends returning to
School <i>after</i> the Easter Vacation. The Doctor, looking complacently
expansive, cheerily anticipative, welcomed them on the doorstep.
<i>They</i> did not welcome <i>him</i>. Oh, dear no! Look at them; the five
senior pupils in front, headed, of course, by that overgrown and somewhat
ungainly Irish boy, Master <span class="sc">Patrick Green</span>, cock of the School,
and prime favourite of Doctor <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>! Can you not fancy them
singing&mdash;after a famous original&mdash;the following quintett?</p>

<h3>MISTER JACKY'S VADE MECUM FOR THE EASTER HOLIDAYS.</h3>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is the chief object you wish to attain during the
Vacation?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> To have the best time possible under the most favourable
conditions.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is the comfort of your relations and friends to be taken into
serious account in attaining this desirable end?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not; the details to which you refer are unworthy of
a moment's consideration.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you any objection to upsetting all the household arrangements
on your arrival?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Unquestionably no. If a morning performance commences at
an hour early enough to require luncheon to be discussed at 12:30,
why the <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la fourchette</i> (as the French would say) must be
partaken within half-an-hour of noon. In like manner, if an evening
representation begins at seven, the dinner-hour must be put back to
half-past five.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If these alterations cause any disturbance of your father's
habits, how would you deal with the matter?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I would not deal with the matter at all. I would leave all
purely necessary explanations to my mother.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> During the time of your vacation will you approve of any
dinner-parties?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I have a rooted objection to such entertainments when the
guests are of my parents' selection. However, I have no objection to
a few fellows, say, like <span class="sc">Smith</span> Major, or <span class="sc">Brown</span> Minor, dropping
in to supper on a Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Assuming that the hour you mention is your parents' favourite
time for peace and quiet, does such an invasion suggest any reflection?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No. If my parents have become slow during my enforced
absence from home in the search of knowledge, it is time they should
have the benefit accruing from contact with my revivifying
characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Supposing your father expostulates with you, and advances
the fact that you have received greater advantages than he himself
enjoyed&mdash;for instance, that you have been to Eton&mdash;what should you
reply?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Practically nothing. However, in the cause of justice and
truth, it might be advisable to answer his statement of fact that
"he had never been to Eton" with the reply, "Anyone could see
that."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If he complains that you do not rise until eleven, smoke
cigarettes in the dining-room before lunch, smash the grand piano
in the drawing-room, lame his favourite cob in the Row, and upset
all his documents in the study, what answer would you make?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That you were not responsible for the training which he had
taken under his personal control. He must be satisfied with the
broad result of your bringing-up.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If he declares his intention of addressing the Superintendent
of your scholastic career on the matter, what would you do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Explain that your present position in the school, to which you
supposed you would have to reluctantly return, was lacking in the
element of popularity, and that any further move in the direction
of increased reduction in that element might possibly lead to your
expulsion. Deprecate personal objection to expulsion, but suggest
that such a course might, by preventing your getting employment
in the Church, Army, or Bar, lead to your being on your parents'
hands for life.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When the time has all but arrived for your return to school,
what should you do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Promptly catch the whooping-cough, the influenza, or
measles. You will then afford a sufficient reason for extending
the length of your vacation indefinitely.</p>

<h3>NOBLE SELF-SACRIFICE.</h3>

<p>"The Duke of <span class="sc">Devonshire</span> has
arranged to return from Monte Carlo
on Saturday," so said the <i>Morning Post</i>,
"in order to address a political meeting
at Glasgow on April 14th." His Grace
having torn himself away from delightful
Monte Carlo, will then attempt to
turn the tables on the <i>Liberales Gladstonienses</i>.
But fancy renouncing sunny
Mount Charles&mdash;"O Charley Mount is
a pleasant place," as sang <i>Miles na
Coppaleen</i>, who was, by the way, miles
away from Monte Carlo&mdash;with its azure
sky, its deep blue sea, its verdant green-cloth
table land, its delightful <i>promenades
&agrave; pied</i>, and its frisky <i>gambols &agrave; la
roulette</i>, where the sunset and sunrise
are <i>rouge</i>, and <i>noir</i> is only "on the
cards." Fancy renouncing these gay
southern delights to live a laborious
day in dry, hard, northern Glasgow!
"O swallow, swallow, flying, flying
South," how would you like to be
checked in your holiday-making airy
career in order to be brought back to
the cold and cruel North? Such a self-sacrifice
as this is indeed memorable.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, March 27.</i>&mdash;The Lowther
Arcade not getting on so well as thought when projected. The
Master Builder been diligently at work, but result disappointing.
On Friday he got terribly snubbed by <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Comes up to-day
to make personal explanation. That a bait at which House usually
jumps; always ready to be amused, or interested with scandal about
Queen <span class="sc">Elizabeth</span> and other persons. These things usually promised
by personal explanation. To-day no flutter of excitement moved
crowded House. <span class="sc">Jemmy</span>, approaching table with most judicial air,
received with mocking laughter, and ironical cheers. Some difficulty
in quite making out what he was at. Evidently something to do
with <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span>; but <span class="sc">Squire</span> so inextricably
mixed up
with Supplementary Estimates, couldn't make out which was which.
<span class="sc">James</span> pounded along in most ponderous style; <span class="sc">Squire</span>
contemptuously
replied; no one else inclined to join in conversation, and
the Master Builder gloomily resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"Never mind," I said, not liking to see an old friend cast down;
"Rome wasn't built in a day, nor the Cave of Adullam excavated in
a week. These things grow. You must have patience, and the
Lowther Arcade will still flourish. Let me see, whom you have got?
There's <span class="sc">Bartley, Hanbury,</span> and <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>. <span class="sc">Lowe</span>,
forming
his Cave, hadn't so many to start with."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Master Builder, "that's all very well; but,
fact is, you can't reckon upon these fellows as being, so to speak,
colonnades in the Arcade. They are all on their own hook;
fighting for their own hand; won't take the lead from me; must go
foraging for themselves. <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> thinks he can boss a show better
than most men. <span class="sc">Bartley's</span> obstreperous. <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> would
be all right if he were left to himself, free from the companionship
of designing men. He is young, ingenuous, not wholly lost
to a sense of regard for his pastors and masters, lack of which is
the curse of modern Youth. I believe <span class="sc">Tommy</span> respects me, and,
only for the evil communications to which he is subject on the
back bench, would work loyally with me in establishing the
Arcade."</p>

<p>There was unwonted moisture in the Master Builder's eye as
he turned round, and regarded the Member for King's Lynn what
time he softly whistled to himself the old Jacobite air, "<i>Tommy
make Room for your Uncle</i>."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote of Censure moved by Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>;
Government majority runs up on division to 47; Ministerialists,
fresh from meeting at Foreign Office, agree that, on whole, have spent
a happy day. Debate spasmodically dull. Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> could
not lift it out of the rut, nor <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> either. Only Mr. G.
shone with effulgent light through gloom of evening. Principal
result of man&oelig;uvre, beyond giving fillip to majority, is that a day
will be filched from meagre holidays, and House must needs sit
on Thursday.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. looked in in time to say a few words in reply to
Prince <span class="sc">Arthur's</span> inquiries as to business arrangements. Later he
came back, and delivered excellent speech; brief, and direct to
point. House been talking all morning round Vote on Account.
<span class="sc">Macfarlane</span> done Rule-of-three sum, to show how twelve hundred
days are lost every week by necessity imposed upon Members of
coming down two hours in advance to take their seats. Some disposition
shown by practical Members to argue question whether there
could be twelve hundred days in any week, even in Leap-Year.</p>

<p>"I know I'm right," said <span class="sc">Macfarlane</span>, and the sceptics, gazing
respectfully at his flowing beard, withdrew from controversy.</p>

<p>House divided on Motion by <span class="sc">Legh</span> to reduce Foreign Office Vote.
Ministerial majority run up at a jump to 225. Time by Westminster
clock, 6.10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>; in twenty minutes, sitting will be suspended;
Vote must be through Committee to-day; <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>
(who hasn't made a speech for a quarter of an hour) on his feet;
sheafs of manuscript in his hand; would certainly oblige to extent
of twenty minutes; <span class="sc">Baron de Worms</span> also has a few remarks to
offer; probable length of Channel Tunnel. Mr. G. interposes.</p>

<p>
"Mr. <span class="sc">Mellor</span>," he said, addressing
Chairman, "I claim to have the
question now put."</p>

<p>Ringing cheers went up from Ministerialists.
<span class="sc">Tommy</span> resumed his seat;
gruefully glanced at notes. The Noble
Baron saw in this man&oelig;uvre fresh
proof that Mr. G. had sold himself to
Germany; having completed preparation
for separation of the Empire on
the side of the Irish Channel, would
immediately after, by medium of
<span class="sc">Watkin's</span> Tunnel, place what was left
of the country at the mercy of a foreign
foe. Meanwhile Closure moved; what's
more, carried on division by swingeing
majority of over a hundred. So Vote
agreed to; Mr. G. gets off for short
drive before dressing for dinner.</p>

<p>Earned a night's rest, and a longer
Easter holiday than he has allotted to
himself and us. Older he gets, the
younger he seems. His work to-day
should make the eight-hours' man
blush. At bay in Downing Street
since twelve o'clock with two hostile
deputations. Came from Ulster and
the City, resolved to beard Home-Rule
Lion in his den. Alone he met them;
one down, the other come on; no interval
of rest; picked men from Ulster,
Selected Captains from the City, surged
around table at which he sat. Hardly
left him time to reply. Having politely conducted Ulster to door,
enter the City Fathers, fresh and eager for fray. Told him over again
in varied phrase how he was bringing country to verge of ruin; listened
with perfect courtesy, as if they'd been discussing someone else&mdash;say,
his next-door neighbour, <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> and Junior Lord
of Downing Street. Up again when last in list of City speakers had
concluded. Almost persuaded <span class="sc">John Lubbock</span> to be a Home-Ruler;
then down to House, dealing with mass of correspondence littering
his table in room behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> chair; alert on sound of
division-bell; comes in to move Closure; remembers that in long
list of speeches never made this particular one before; looks up
<span class="sc">Palgrave's</span> <i>Handbook</i>; cons his lesson and declaims brief formula
in deep rich voice that lends touch of eloquence to its unadorned,
remorseless demand. All this, too, following on a day like yesterday,
when two other deputations stormed Downing Street; drew
from him weighty reply; followed, after hasty dinner, by a speech
in the House on the eternal Irish question, which <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>
rightly termed, "entrancing."</p>

<p>"A Grand Old Man, indeed!" said
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, talking over these
things to-night, when he should have
been listening to <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, who
having at the morning sitting had his
speech on Vote on Account closured,
delivered another at evening sitting
on the question of the Depreciation of
Silver as it affects domestic architecture
in China and Peru.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote on Account
through Committee.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Caine</span> going about
House this afternoon, his slim figure
bulging out at the pockets in mysterious
fashion, "Brought your supper
with you?" I asked, lightly touching
one of the excrescences that felt like
an imperial pint of ginger-beer (<span class="sc">White</span>
1880). "You seem bursting with broiled
bones. All no use. No more all-night
sittings <i>this</i> side of Easter."</p>

<p>"No, my boy, you're wrong," said
<span class="sc">Caine</span>. "Fact is, I'm going off to the
country, and these protuberances you
observe about my person are phonograms.
All labelled, you see," he said,
taking out cylinders from several
pockets. "Here are a few remarks on
Registration; that's my Local-Veto
Speech; and here is an entirely new
view of the Home-Rule question. If
you like to come over to my house at
Clapham&mdash;close by, you know, busses every ten minutes&mdash;you shall
have a night's thorough enjoyment. Leave you in the room by yourself
with the phonograph. Pop in one of these cylinders; set the
phonograph whizzing; and you'll hear me on Local Veto. Take
out cylinder, put in another, and you'll know more about Home
Rule in five minutes than you ever dreamt. Can only let you have
them for to-night. To-morrow they go down to Yorkshire, and thro'
Easter Recess I shall be delivering, at various places, six speeches
every night, I myself comfortably making holiday in Wales."
"Thank you," I said; "but, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go
home and go to bed." In truth, a little depressed. Here's a nice
prospect for the holidays! Bad enough to have Members working
off at public meetings speeches that had been closured in Commons.
But if every man is, during the recess, to multiply himself by
phonography, the last state of this country will be worse than the first.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Adjourned for Easter Holidays. Just escaped
sitting over Good Friday. Back next Thursday.</p>
